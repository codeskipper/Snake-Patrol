# Scans for Python installations on macOS, and run CVE-2015-20107.py script from working directory to report whether
# patching is needed.
# Use sudo to search the entire macOS root filesystem as root user.

# Make sure to run this from an app with Full Disk Access permission - i.e. ensure iTerm.app has
# Full Disk Access enabled in Apple System Settings, Security & Privacy Privacy & Security.

# WIP: detect if script has full disk access permission and bail out if not
